# Phase 2: Build Process Standardization

## Overview

This document provides a detailed implementation plan for Phase 2 of the TAP Integration Platform standardization project. Phase 2 focuses on creating consistent, reliable build processes for both frontend and backend services.

## 1. Frontend Build Standardization

### Issues to Address:
- Multiple conflicting webpack configurations
- Missing Docker-specific webpack options
- Improper file watching configuration for containerized environments
- Inconsistent dev server implementations

### Implementation Plan:

1. **Consolidate Webpack Configurations**:
   - Create a single webpack.config.js entry point
   - Implement environment-specific configuration with proper inheritance
   - Standardize common configurations across environments
   - Remove duplicate configuration files

2. **Implement Docker-Specific Configuration**:
   - Create a Docker-specific webpack configuration
   - Configure file watching with poll option for Docker environments
   - Set appropriate host/port bindings for containerized development
   - Fix websocket configuration for hot reloading

3. **Standardize Dev Server Implementation**:
   - Consolidate dev-server.js implementations
   - Create a unified server implementation with environment detection
   - Add Docker-specific optimizations
   - Implement proper error handling and logging

4. **Fix Module Resolution**:
   - Add proper aliases for deep import paths
   - Fix path resolution incompatibilities in Docker environments
   - Standardize import patterns

## 2. Backend Build Standardization

### Issues to Address:
- Inconsistent Python environment setup
- Issues with entrypoint scripts
- Missing requirements management

### Implementation Plan:

1. **Standardize Python Environment Setup**:
   - Create a consistent virtual environment setup
   - Standardize Python version across environments
   - Implement proper volume mounting for Python modules

2. **Fix Entrypoint Script Issues**:
   - Refactor the entrypoint.sh script
   - Add proper error handling and logging
   - Implement environment-based configuration
   - Ensure proper permissions and execution

3. **Implement Requirements Management**:
   - Separate core requirements from development dependencies
   - Implement requirements validation
   - Add version pinning for all dependencies
   - Document requirements update process

## 3. Build Verification Tools

### Issues to Address:
- Lack of automated build verification
- Inconsistent build artifact quality
- No standard build testing process

### Implementation Plan:

1. **Create Frontend Build Verification**:
   - Implement a build verification script
   - Check for required bundle files
   - Validate bundle sizes and content
   - Test HTML/JS/CSS validity

2. **Create Backend Build Verification**:
   - Implement a Python package verification tool
   - Check for required modules and dependencies
   - Validate module imports and compatibility
   - Test backend service startup

3. **Integrate into Workflow**:
   - Add build verification to docker-compose startup
   - Create pre-commit hooks for build verification
   - Document build verification process and outputs

## Implementation Steps:

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/build-standardization`
2. Frontend:
   - Consolidate webpack configurations
   - Implement Docker-specific webpack config
   - Standardize dev server implementation
3. Backend:
   - Fix entrypoint scripts
   - Standardize Python environment setup
   - Implement proper requirements management
4. Create and test build verification tools
5. Document changes and update master.log

## Testing Strategy:

1. **Frontend Build Testing**:
   - Test production builds
   - Test development builds in Docker
   - Verify hot reloading functionality
   - Validate bundle sizes and content

2. **Backend Build Testing**:
   - Test Python module imports
   - Verify service startup in different environments
   - Check for dependency conflicts
   - Test entrypoint script functionality

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test complete system build process
   - Verify communication between services
   - Test build artifacts in different environments

## Success Criteria:

1. Frontend builds successfully with a single configuration entry point
2. Backend environment setup is consistent and reliable
3. Hot reloading works properly in Docker environment
4. Build verification tools validate builds correctly
5. Build times are reasonable and predictable

## Timeline:

- Day 1: Frontend webpack configuration consolidation
- Day 2: Backend environment and entrypoint standardization
- Day 3: Build verification tools implementation
- Day 4: Testing and documentation
