# Phase 1: Docker Configuration Standardization

## Overview

This document provides a detailed implementation plan for Phase 1 of the TAP Integration Platform standardization project. Phase 1 focuses on standardizing Docker configurations to enable reliable container startup and orchestration.

## 1. Docker Compose Configuration

### Issues to Address:
- Missing or incorrect health checks
- Missing restart policies
- Improper service dependency configuration
- Misidentified services in the error report

### Implementation Plan:

1. **Fix docker-compose.yml**:
   - Update service definitions to use proper health check configurations
   - Add standardized restart policies
   - Configure proper dependency chains with health conditions
   - Remove any invalid service entries that might have been identified in error reports

2. **Standardize Environment Variables**:
   - Create consistent environment variable naming conventions
   - Implement default values for all environment variables
   - Document required and optional environment variables

## 2. Signal Handling Implementation

### Issues to Address:
- Missing SIGTERM signal handlers for graceful container shutdown
- No graceful shutdown process in backend Python services
- No proper resource cleanup on container termination

### Implementation Plan:

1. **Backend Signal Handling**:
   - Create a signal handling module in the backend
   - Implement handlers for SIGTERM and SIGINT
   - Add proper resource cleanup on shutdown
   - Ensure database connections are closed gracefully

2. **Frontend Signal Handling**:
   - Add signal handlers to dev-server.js
   - Ensure webpack dev server shuts down gracefully
   - Implement cleanup hooks for frontend resources

## 3. Health Check Implementation

### Issues to Address:
- Inconsistent health check implementations
- Health checks that don't verify core functionality
- Health check timing issues
 
### Implementation Plan:

1. **Standardize Backend Health Checks**:
   - Create a comprehensive health check endpoint
   - Verify database connectivity
   - Check file system access
   - Add status response with component health information

2. **Standardize Frontend Health Checks**:
   - Improve the existing health check script
   - Add verification for webpack dev server status
   - Check for proper environment configuration
   - Add appropriate exit codes and logging

3. **Update Docker Compose Health Check Configuration**:
   - Standardize health check timing (interval, timeout, retries)
   - Set appropriate start periods to allow for service initialization
   - Implement conditional health check commands

## 4. Service Orchestration Improvements

### Issues to Address:
- Improper service startup order
- Missing health-based dependencies
- No circuit breaker patterns for dependent services

### Implementation Plan:

1. **Update Dependency Configuration**:
   - Configure frontend to depend on backend with health condition
   - Add proper condition: service_healthy for all dependencies
   - Implement wait-for scripts if needed for complex dependencies

2. **Implement Basic Circuit Breaker**:
   - Add retry logic to service connections
   - Implement basic fallback mechanisms
   - Document failure scenarios and recovery procedures

## Implementation Steps:

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/docker-standardization`
2. Make changes to docker-compose.yml first
3. Implement backend signal handlers
4. Update health check implementations
5. Test each service independently
6. Test the complete system with docker-compose up
7. Document changes and update master.log

## Testing Strategy:

1. **Individual Service Tests**:
   - Verify each service starts correctly in isolation
   - Test health check endpoints return appropriate status codes
   - Verify signal handlers work by sending signals to containers

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Start the complete system with docker-compose
   - Verify service orchestration and dependencies
   - Test graceful shutdown with docker-compose down

3. **Resilience Tests**:
   - Test recovery from service failures
   - Verify health check failures are properly reported
   - Test dependency chain behavior when services are unhealthy

## Success Criteria:

1. All services start successfully with docker-compose up
2. Services start in the correct order based on dependencies
3. Health checks accurately report service status
4. Services shut down gracefully when receiving SIGTERM
5. Resources are properly cleaned up on shutdown

## Timeline:

- Day 1: Docker compose configuration and environment variable standardization
- Day 2: Signal handling implementation and health check improvements
- Day 3: Service orchestration improvements and testing
