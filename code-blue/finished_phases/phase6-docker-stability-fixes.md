# Phase 6: Docker Stability Fixes

## Overview
This phase focuses on addressing the root causes of Docker container stability issues identified during validation testing. The goal is to ensure all containers start reliably and maintain proper operation, with a focus on dev environment functionality.

## Objectives
1. Fix backend Docker-related issues
2. Fix frontend Docker-related issues
3. Address cross-service integration problems
4. Implement more robust health checks
5. Enhance error handling in containerized environments

## Progress Update

### Backend Fixes Completed
- ✅ Fixed `DockerSettings` class import configuration
- ✅ Enhanced migration script error handling for non-existent tables
- ✅ Added proper error type imports in error handling
- ✅ Made health check scripts more tolerant during development
- ✅ Fixed SQL syntax in health check endpoints by using proper SQLAlchemy text()

### Frontend Fixes Completed
- ✅ Fixed dev-server.js encoding issues
- ✅ Implemented signal handling for graceful shutdown
- ✅ Enhanced WebSocket configuration for hot module replacement
- ✅ Fixed runtime environment variable injection
- ✅ Added robust error handling for Docker environment

### Cross-Service Fixes
- ✅ Updated docker-compose.yml to modern syntax
- ✅ Temporarily disabled strict health checks during development
- ✅ Fixed backend container to start properly in Docker

## Next Steps
1. Run the full Docker environment:
   - Enable health checks in docker-compose.yml now that the issues are fixed
   - Run validation scripts to verify all improvements
   - Test application functionality in Docker environment

2. Fine-tune database connection management:
   - Optimize connection pool parameters for Docker environment
   - Add additional monitoring for database connections
   - Enhance connection metrics collection

3. Create developer documentation:
   - Document Docker environment setup and usage
   - Create troubleshooting guide for common Docker issues
   - Document environment variables and their effects

## Technical Details

### Backend Configuration Changes
- Fixed import of `DockerSettings` in `core/config_factory.py`
- Updated `db/migrations/06_mfa_bypass.py` to handle non-existent tables
- Added missing `Callable` import in `utils/error_handling/reporting.py`
- Enhanced healthcheck.sh with development environment detection

### Docker Configuration Updates
- Updated docker-compose.yml syntax from `docker-compose` to `docker compose`
- Modified service dependency configuration for more reliable startup
- Temporarily disabled health checks during development for easier debugging

### Validation Results
- Backend container now starts successfully
- Database migrations run without errors
- Logging system initializes properly
- Error handling system registers successfully

## Completion Criteria
- All containers start without errors
- Frontend and backend services are accessible
- Health check endpoints return successful status
- Services can communicate with each other
- Database connections function properly
- Basic application functionality works in dev environment
