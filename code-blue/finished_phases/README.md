# TAP Integration Platform Standardization Project

## Overview

This project aims to standardize the TAP Integration Platform, addressing Docker configuration issues, build process inconsistencies, and developer workflow challenges. The goal is to create a robust, production-ready application that can be reliably built and run in Docker environments.

## Project Structure

- **audit-reports/**: Contains detailed audit findings and analysis
- **project-management/**: Project planning, roadmap, and tracking documents
  - **implementation-templates/**: Templates for key component implementations
- **standardization-plan/**: Detailed plans for each phase of the project
- **master.log**: Project progress log

## Phased Approach

The project follows a phased approach to standardization:

1. **Phase 1**: Docker Configuration Standardization
2. **Phase 2**: Build Process Standardization
3. **Phase 3**: Error Handling and Logging Improvements
4. **Phase 4**: Development Workflow Optimization

## Current Status

The project is currently in the planning phase. The following documents are available:

- [Audit Summary](./project-management/audit-summary.md): Summary of findings from the code audit
- [Standardization Plan](./standardization-plan/standardization-plan.md): Overall approach to standardization
- [Project Roadmap](./project-management/project-roadmap.md): Timeline and milestones

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Review the audit summary to understand the current issues
2. Examine the standardization plan to understand the approach
3. Follow the implementation plans for each phase
4. Use the provided templates for implementation

## Implementation Status

| Phase | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Phase 1 | Planning | Docker Configuration Standardization |
| Phase 2 | Planning | Build Process Standardization |
| Phase 3 | Planning | Error Handling and Logging Improvements |
| Phase 4 | Planning | Development Workflow Optimization |

## Contributing

When implementing changes for this project:

1. Create a feature branch for each phase or major component
2. Follow the implementation plans and templates
3. Test thoroughly before merging
4. Update the master.log with progress

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful when:

1. All services start and communicate correctly in Docker
2. Builds complete successfully and consistently
3. Error handling and logging work as expected
4. Developer experience is streamlined and documented
