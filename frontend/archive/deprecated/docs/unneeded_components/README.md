# Unneeded Components Documentation

This directory contains documentation of components that have been identified as unused in the codebase and are candidates for removal. These components were identified during the code cleanup project.

## Components Not Found in Imports

The following components were mentioned in the design system implementation documentation but appear to not be used anywhere in the codebase:

1. **SearchFilterPanel** - No imports found
2. **FilterBuilder** - No imports found 
3. **CachingDemo** - No imports found
4. **AccessibilityReport** - No imports found
5. **AccessibilityTester** - No imports found

## Documentation Components

These components may have been created for documentation purposes only and aren't used in the actual application:

1. **SearchFilterPanel** - Likely created for the enhanced search feature but never implemented
2. **FilterBuilder** - May have been intended as a companion to SearchFilterPanel
3. **CachingDemo** - Probably created to demonstrate caching capabilities but not used in production
4. **AccessibilityReport** - Created for accessibility testing and documentation
5. **AccessibilityTester** - Used for demonstrating accessibility features

## Removal Recommendations

These components are safe to remove from the codebase as they do not appear to be used anywhere. However, the documentation of their intended functionality has been preserved here for future reference.

### SearchFilterPanel

Intended to provide advanced filtering capabilities for the search feature:

### CachingDemo

A demonstration component showing caching capabilities:
- Cache invalidation examples
- Performance comparison with/without caching
- Cache strategy visualization

### AccessibilityReport

A component for generating accessibility reports:
- WCAG compliance checking
- Accessibility score calculation
- Issue categorization
- Remediation suggestions

### AccessibilityTester

A component for testing accessibility features:
