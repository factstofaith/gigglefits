## Issues and Challenges
- Managing API compatibility with complex components (e.g., DataTable)
- Ensuring consistent styling across all components
- Handling nested component structures (e.g., Dialogs with forms)
- Implementing temporary simplified versions of components that will be enhanced later
- Handling third-party dependencies like @mui/x-date-pickers
- Working with complex form components like DateTimePicker
- Setting up proper test environments for components that rely on theme providers
- Handling deep component dependencies in test scenarios

## Next Steps
- Run visual consistency testing across all migrated components
- Implement Percy for visual regression testing
- Prepare comprehensive summary report on all sprint completions
- Begin planning for phase 2 of design system adoption:
  - Evaluate remaining components for migration
  - Identify patterns for direct adoption of design system components (non-legacy)
  - Review performance impact of migration and identify optimization opportunities
  - Plan gradual removal of legacy wrapper components where possible
- Document lessons learned and best practices for future design system migrations
