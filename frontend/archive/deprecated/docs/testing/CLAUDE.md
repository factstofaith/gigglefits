# Comprehensive Testing Implementation Plan

## Test Infrastructure Guide

### Utility Testing (Pure Functions)
For testing utility functions that don't depend on React or complex browser APIs, we've established a simplified and robust approach:

1. **Dedicated Configuration**: Use the `jest.utils.config.js` configuration with the `npm run test:utils` script
2. **Simplified Setup**: Minimizes dependencies on complex infrastructure like MSW
3. **Environment Mocks**: Basic browser API mocks (URL, matchMedia, etc.) that most utilities need
4. **Isolation**: Allows testing utility functions independently of React components or API services

This approach provides several advantages:
- Avoids dependency conflicts that can occur with the full test configuration
- Makes tests more stable and less likely to break due to infrastructure changes
- Provides faster test execution for simple utility functions
- Creates cleaner tests focused on functionality rather than setup

**Example Usage**:
```bash
# Run all utility tests
npm run test:utils

# Run a specific utility test file
npm run test:utils -- src/tests/utils/flowValidation.test.js
```

#### Browser API Mocking Patterns

When testing utilities that interact with browser APIs (especially read-only properties), use these established patterns:

1. **Navigator Property Mocking**: Replace the entire navigator object instead of individual properties
   ```javascript
   // In your test file
   const mockNavigator = (properties) => {
     Object.defineProperty(global, 'navigator', {
       value: { ...navigator, ...properties },
       writable: true,
       configurable: true
     });
   };
   
   // Usage
   mockNavigator({
     serviceWorker: {}, // Mock serviceWorker
     maxTouchPoints: 5, // Mock touch points
     permissions: {}    // Mock permissions API
   });
   ```

2. **Module-Level Function Mocking**: For mocking imported functions
   ```javascript
   // Get reference to original module and function
   const originalModule = require('../../utils/yourModule');
   const originalImpl = originalModule.functionName;
   
   // Replace with mock implementation
   const mockImpl = jest.fn().mockReturnValue(mockReturnValue);
   originalModule.functionName = mockImpl;
   
   // Run tests...
   
   // Restore original implementation
   originalModule.functionName = originalImpl;
   ```

3. **Console Method Mocking**: Use spies for clean console mocking
   ```javascript
   // Setup
   let consoleErrorSpy;
   beforeEach(() => {
     consoleErrorSpy = jest.spyOn(console, 'error').mockImplementation(() => {});
   });
   
   afterEach(() => {
     consoleErrorSpy.mockRestore();
   });
   
   // In test
   expect(console.error).toHaveBeenCalled();
   ```

4. **Clean Property Tracking**: Store and restore original properties
   ```javascript
   const originalProps = { 
     window: {},
     navigator: {},
     element: {} 
   };
   
   beforeAll(() => {
     // Store original values
     originalProps.window.Notification = window.Notification;
     originalProps.navigator.serviceWorker = navigator.serviceWorker;
     originalProps.element.animate = Element.prototype.animate;
   });
   
   afterAll(() => {
     // Restore original values
     window.Notification = originalProps.window.Notification;
     // Other restorations...
   });
   ```

These patterns provide a robust approach to testing utilities that depend on browser APIs and should be used consistently across the test suite.

### Component Testing (Coming Soon)
Component testing infrastructure is under development and will be documented here when complete.

## Project Overview
The TAP Integration Platform testing initiative aims to establish a robust, comprehensive testing framework that ensures application reliability, performance, and maintainability. The project will involve setting up proper testing infrastructure, implementing best-practice test patterns, and systematically building test coverage across the entire application.

## Bug Tracking

### Critical Issues
_This section will be populated as testing reveals critical issues_

### High Priority Issues
_This section will be populated as testing reveals high priority issues_

### Medium Priority Issues
1. **Module-level Service Mocking Issue in UserContext Tests**: 
   - Description: The UserContext.jsx file creates an API service at the module level, making it difficult to mock effectively for tests as the service is initialized before our mocks are applied.
   - Impact: 12 of 21 tests for UserContext are failing because the mock functions aren't being called as expected.
   - Potential Solutions:
     - Implement a more sophisticated mocking approach that ensures the mocks are applied before module initialization.
     - Consider refactoring UserContext.jsx to use dependency injection for better testability.
     - Explore jest.doMock() with a factory reset pattern between tests.

### Low Priority Issues
_This section will be populated as testing reveals low priority issues_

## Test Coverage Progress

### Unit Test Coverage
- Current: TBD
- Target: 80%+

### Integration Test Coverage
- Current: TBD
- Target: 70%+

### E2E Test Coverage
- Current: TBD
- Target: Key user flows 100%

## Best Practices Reference

### Unit Testing Principles
1. Tests should be independent and isolated
2. Each test should verify a single responsibility
3. Use descriptive test names that explain the behavior being tested
4. Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
5. Avoid testing implementation details when possible
6. Mock external dependencies consistently
7. Optimize for readability and maintainability

### Component Testing Guidelines
1. Test component rendering without errors
2. Test props handling and conditional rendering
3. Test user interactions (clicks, input changes, etc.)
4. Test error states and loading states
5. Test accessibility requirements
6. Test component lifecycle and side effects
7. Use proper assertions for different component behaviors

### E2E Testing Best Practices
1. Focus on critical user journeys
2. Use stable selectors (data-testid attributes)
3. Simulate real user behavior
4. Handle asynchronous operations properly
5. Manage test data carefully
6. Isolate tests from each other
7. Consider test run performance and stability
