/**
 * TECHNICAL DEBT NOTE:

 * implementations of design system components. It makes the minimum changes needed to make
 * the build pass, while clearly documenting what needs to be done properly.
 * 
 * The proper fix is to implement each of these components following design system guidelines.
 * This should be tracked as a separate task and prioritized accordingly.
