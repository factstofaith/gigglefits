# TypeScript Implementation Plan - Remaining Components

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing TypeScript definitions for the remaining adapted components. We've already completed TypeScript implementation for the core complex components and established the build process integration.

## Current Status

- ✅ TypeScript build integration
- ✅ Core type definitions
- ✅ Complex component interfaces
- ✅ 21 of 30 components have declaration (.d.ts) files
- ✅ 26 of 30 components have JSDoc TypeScript annotations

## Implementation Process

For each remaining component:

1. **Add JSDoc TypeScript Annotations**
   ```jsx
   /**
    * @typedef {import('../../types/form').ComponentProps} ComponentProps
    * @type {React.ForwardRefExoticComponent<ComponentProps & React.RefAttributes<HTMLElement>>}
    */
   ```

2. **Create Declaration File**
   ```typescript
   import React from 'react';
   import { ComponentProps } from '../../types/form';

   declare const ComponentAdapted: React.ForwardRefExoticComponent<
     ComponentProps & React.RefAttributes<HTMLElement>
   >;

   export default ComponentAdapted;
   ```

3. **Verify Type Integration**
   - Run `npm run typecheck` after each implementation
   - Ensure no type errors are introduced

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**
   - Form components (TextFieldAdapted, SelectAdapted)
   - Commonly used display components (CardAdapted, AvatarAdapted)

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Feedback components (AlertAdapted, TooltipAdapted)
   - Remaining display components (ChipAdapted, TableHeadAdapted)

3. **Low Priority**
   - Specialized components (AccordionSummaryAdapted, AccordionDetailsAdapted)
   - Less frequently used components (SkeletonAdapted)

## Development Assignment

We recommend dividing the implementation work across team members:

- **Developer A**: Form components
- **Developer B**: Display components
- **Developer C**: Feedback and Navigation components

This parallel implementation approach will help us complete the TypeScript integration more efficiently.

## Validation Strategy

After implementation:

1. Run comprehensive type checking: `npm run typecheck:verbose`
2. Test component usage with type checking
3. Verify declaration file exports
4. Check for type consistency across the component hierarchy

## Timeline

- Week 1: Complete all JSDoc annotations
- Week 2: Implement declaration files for high priority components
- Week 3: Implement declaration files for medium priority components
- Week 4: Implement declaration files for low priority components
- Week 5: Comprehensive validation and type checking
