## Implementation Details

### Recent Progress

We have successfully implemented TypeScript for the TableBodyAdapted component:

1. **TableBodyAdapted**:
   - Added JSDoc TypeScript annotations referencing TableBodyProps interface
   - Created declaration file with ForwardRefExoticComponent pattern
   - Added proper typing for TableBodyRowAdapted and TableBodyCellAdapted as named exports
   - Implemented proper component composition pattern in types
   - Added comprehensive documentation with example usage for both standard and virtualized modes
   - Ensured proper typing for virtualization features

Previously, we implemented TypeScript for:

1. **TableHeadAdapted**:
   - Added JSDoc TypeScript annotations referencing TableHeadProps interface
   - Created declaration file with ForwardRefExoticComponent pattern
   - Added proper typing for TableHeadCellAdapted as a named export
   - Implemented proper component composition pattern in types
   - Added comprehensive documentation with example usage
   - Ensured proper accessibility typing support

Previously, we implemented TypeScript for:

1. **DataPreviewAdapted**:
   - Added JSDoc TypeScript annotations referencing DataPreviewProps interface
   - Created declaration file with proper typing
   - Added comprehensive documentation for this complex component
   - Added detailed feature list in the declaration file
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing implementations

Previously, we also implemented TypeScript for:

1. **ChipAdapted**:
   - Added JSDoc TypeScript annotations referencing ChipProps interface
   - Created declaration file with HTMLDivElement ref type
   - Used ForwardRefExoticComponent pattern for proper typing
   - Ensured comprehensive documentation in declaration file
   - Added detailed component description with features list

2. **SelectAdapted**:
   - Added proper JSDoc TypeScript annotations referencing SelectProps interface
   - Created declaration file with HTMLSelectElement ref type
   - Added virtualization support in type definitions
   - Ensured proper accessibility type inclusion

3. **CheckboxAdapted**:
   - Added JSDoc TypeScript annotations with CheckboxProps interface
   - Created declaration file with HTMLInputElement ref type
   - Added proper indeterminate state typing
   - Included accessibility properties in type interface

4. **RadioGroupAdapted**:
   - Added JSDoc TypeScript annotations with RadioGroupProps interface
   - Created declaration file with HTMLDivElement ref type
   - Implemented proper event handler typing
   - Added accessibility properties for screen readers

5. **AutocompleteAdapted**:
   - Added JSDoc TypeScript annotations with generic typing
   - Created declaration file with proper generic type support
   - Implemented virtualization typing in the interface
   - Added comprehensive documentation

6. **DatePickerAdapted**:
   - Added JSDoc TypeScript annotations for date handling
   - Created declaration file with proper date validation types
   - Included format and mask typing
   - Added comprehensive documentation

7. **CardAdapted** and **CardContentAdapted**:
   - Added JSDoc TypeScript annotations for both components
   - Created declaration files with proper ref typing
   - Updated CardProps and CardContentProps interfaces 
   - Added comprehensive documentation

8. **AvatarAdapted**:
   - Added JSDoc TypeScript annotations
   - Created declaration file with proper HTMLDivElement ref
   - Updated AvatarProps interface with size and color options
   - Added comprehensive documentation

All components were implemented following the established patterns:
- Using appropriate component types (ForwardRefExoticComponent or FC)
- Implementing consistent props interface inheritance
- Following the same documentation standards
- Maintaining backward compatibility

## Next Steps

### High Priority Components

The next components to implement are:

1. **TableHeadAdapted**: Part of the table component system
2. **TableBodyAdapted**: Part of the table component system

### Medium Priority Components

After completing the high-priority components, we will focus on:

1. **AlertAdapted**: Feedback component for notifications
2. **TooltipAdapted**: Feedback component for additional information

### Low Priority Components

Finally, we will implement the remaining specialized components:

1. **AccordionSummaryAdapted**: Part of the accordion component
2. **AccordionDetailsAdapted**: Part of the accordion component
3. **SkeletonAdapted**: Loading state component
4. **LinkAdapted**: Navigation component
5. **PaginationAdapted**: Navigation component

## Timeline

- Week 1: Complete form components - 7/7 done (100%)
- Week 2 (Current): Complete high-priority display components - 9/11 done (82%)
- Week 3: Complete feedback components
- Week 4: Complete remaining components
- Week 5: Comprehensive validation and documentation

## Conclusion

The TypeScript implementation is progressing well, with 23 out of 30 components (76.7%) now fully typed. We have completed all form components (7/7) and all display components (11/11). The implementation follows consistent patterns, ensuring a uniform type system across the design system. We are now ready to move on to the feedback components (AlertAdapted, AccordionSummaryAdapted, AccordionDetailsAdapted, TooltipAdapted, and SkeletonAdapted) and navigation components (LinkAdapted and PaginationAdapted).
