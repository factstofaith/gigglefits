# TAP Integration Platform - Flow Canvas Next Steps

## Current Progress

We have successfully implemented the following components for the Flow Canvas:

1. **FlowCanvas.jsx**: A comprehensive drag-and-drop canvas using ReactFlow with:
   - Custom node types and edge components
   - Drag-and-drop interface for adding nodes
   - Selection, deletion, and basic editing of nodes and edges
   - Basic undo/redo functionality
   - Flow validation with error indicators
   - Context menu for adding nodes
   - Notification system for feedback

2. **Custom Node Types**:
   - SourceNode.jsx - For data sources with type-specific styling
   - DestinationNode.jsx - For data destinations with input handle
   - TransformationNode.jsx - For data transformation with input and output handles
   - FilterNode.jsx - For filtering and routing data with input and output handles

3. **Custom Edge Component**:
   - FlowEdge.jsx - Custom edge with validation indicators and styling

4. **NodePanel.jsx**:
   - Categorized display of available nodes
   - Role-based filtering of nodes
   - Search functionality
   - Drag-and-drop capability
   - Tooltips with node descriptions

5. **Integration Workflow**:
   - IntegrationCreationDialog.jsx - For creating new integrations
   - Updated IntegrationsPage.jsx and IntegrationDetailPage.jsx
   - Integration of FlowCanvas into IntegrationDetailPage.jsx

## Next Tasks

### 1. Task 1.3.3: Implement enhanced connector lines with validation

While we have basic connector lines with validation indicators, we need to enhance them with:

- **Advanced Validation Logic**:
  - Type compatibility checking between source and target nodes
  - Data format validation with detailed error messages
  - Required field validation for connections
  - Cycle detection to prevent infinite loops

- **Enhanced Visual Indicators**:
  - Flow direction with animated paths
  - Connection type indicators (data, control, event)
  - Throughput visualization for active flows
  - Status indicators for active/inactive connections

- **Interaction Improvements**:
  - Click to select connection with property panel
  - Context menu with connection actions
  - Breakpoints for debugging
  - Connection labels with custom text

### 2. Task 1.3.4: Add support for multiple sources/destinations

Currently, our flow canvas supports basic connections between nodes. We need to enhance it for complex multi-source/destination scenarios:

- **Data Merging Configuration**:
  - Visual indicators for parallel data flows
  - Priority settings for conflict resolution
  - Merge strategies (union, intersection, override)
  - Visual feedback for data merging points

- **Fan-out Capabilities**:
  - Support for one-to-many connections
  - Connection groups for related outputs
  - Visual distinction between primary and secondary flows
  - Flow-specific configuration options

- **Connection Constraints**:
  - Define maximum connections per port
  - Type-specific connection limitations
  - Required connections for valid flows
  - Visual indicators for missing required connections

- **Flow Visualization**:
  - Flow path highlighting on hover/selection
  - Multi-path tracing for complex flows
  - Visual distinction between main and auxiliary paths
  - Path grouping for logical separation

### 3. Task 1.3.5: Enhance undo/redo with comprehensive history tracking

While we have basic undo/redo functionality, we need to enhance it with:

- **Comprehensive History Management**:
  - Fine-grained history tracking for all operations
  - Operation grouping for complex actions
  - History persistence between sessions
  - History browsing with previews

- **Advanced History Features**:
  - Named checkpoints for important states
  - Branching history capabilities
  - History comparison tool
  - History search and filtering

- **User Experience Improvements**:
  - Visual preview of undo/redo actions
  - Operation descriptions in history
  - Keyboard shortcuts for efficient navigation
  - Context-aware history management

## Implementation Approach

Following our zero technical debt approach, we'll implement these features with:

1. **Clean Architecture**:
   - Strict separation between UI components and flow logic
   - Pure functions for flow operations
   - Immutable data structures for history management
   - Comprehensive interfaces for all components

2. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Unit tests for all flow operations
   - Visual regression tests for UI components
   - Interaction tests for user flows
   - Performance testing for large flows

3. **Documentation**:
   - Inline JSDoc comments for all functions and components
   - Usage examples for complex features
   - Architectural decision records
   - Visual diagrams for complex workflows

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Memoization for complex calculations
   - Virtualization for large flows
   - Efficient history storage and management
   - Optimized rendering for complex edges and nodes

By completing these tasks, we'll have a fully-featured flow canvas that supports complex integration scenarios with excellent usability and robustness.
