# TAP Integration Platform Accessibility Implementation

This document outlines the accessibility enhancements implemented in the TAP Integration Platform frontend as part of our ongoing refactoring project. These improvements help ensure the application is usable by all users, including those with disabilities, and comply with accessibility standards.

## Overview

Our accessibility implementation follows these key principles:

- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements are accessible via keyboard
- **Screen Reader Support**: Content is properly labeled and announced to screen readers
- **Focus Management**: Focus is trapped appropriately in modals and managed during navigation
- **Semantic HTML**: Using proper HTML elements for their intended purpose
- **ARIA Attributes**: Appropriate ARIA attributes are used when native HTML semantics aren't sufficient
- **Color Contrast**: Ensuring sufficient contrast for text and interactive elements
- **Responsive Design**: Components adapt to different viewport sizes and zoom levels

## Accessibility Utilities

We've created a comprehensive utility library (`accessibilityUtils.js`) with the following features:

### 1. Focus Management

- `useFocusTrap`: A custom hook that traps focus within modal dialogs and similar components
- `useSkipNav`: A hook that adds a "Skip to main content" link for keyboard users

### 2. Screen Reader Announcements

- `announceToScreenReader`: Function to announce dynamic content changes to screen readers

### 3. ARIA Attribute Helpers

- `getAriaAttributes`: Function that generates appropriate ARIA attributes based on component state
- `getFormControlProps`: Function that generates accessibility props specifically for form controls

### 4. Keyboard Navigation Helpers

- `getKeyboardHandlers`: Function that creates keyboard event handlers for common patterns
- `useKeyboardNavigation`: A hook for managing keyboard navigation in lists, menus, and similar components

### 5. Color Contrast Utilities

- `getContrastInfo`: Function to check if colors meet WCAG contrast requirements

## Component Enhancements

We've enhanced several key components with accessibility features:

### 1. Button Component

- Added proper ARIA attributes (aria-pressed, aria-expanded, etc.)
- Improved keyboard handling with space and enter keys
- Added proper focus styles
- Ensured proper color contrast

### 2. Modal Components (PortalModal, AuthModal)

- Trapped focus within the modal
- Added proper ARIA attributes (role="dialog", aria-modal="true")
- Implemented Escape key handling
- Managed focus when opening/closing
- Added proper heading structure
- Ensured all interactive elements have appropriate labels

### 3. Error Boundary

- Added proper ARIA live regions for announcing errors
- Improved focus management during error states
- Added descriptive labels for error details
- Enhanced keyboard navigation for error recovery options

## Global Application Changes

### 1. App Component

- Added skip navigation link for keyboard users
- Created consistent document language attribute
- Set up screen reader announcer for dynamic content
- Added main content landmark with proper ID for skip navigation
- Ensured modal root exists for portal-based components

### 2. AppRoutes Component (existing)

- Already had proper error boundaries around lazy-loaded routes
- Uses Suspense for loading states

## Testing Recommendations

To ensure these accessibility enhancements are working properly, we recommend:

1. **Keyboard Navigation Testing**:
   - Tab through the entire application to ensure all interactive elements are focusable
   - Verify focus trapping in modals
   - Test skip navigation functionality

2. **Screen Reader Testing**:
   - Test with popular screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
   - Verify announcements for dynamic content changes
   - Check that all images have appropriate alt text

3. **Automated Testing**:
   - Implement unit tests for accessibility utilities
   - Add automated accessibility testing using tools like axe-core or jest-axe
   - Include accessibility checks in CI/CD pipeline

4. **Manual Testing**:
   - Perform testing with users who rely on assistive technologies
   - Use the WAVE browser extension to identify issues
   - Check color contrast with tools like WebAIM's Color Contrast Checker

## Future Improvements

While we've made significant progress, there are additional accessibility enhancements to consider:

1. **Implement Accessible Drag and Drop** for the integration flow builder
2. **Add Live Regions** for real-time updates in the integration monitoring views
3. **Enhance Form Validation** with clear error messages and suggestions
4. **Implement Reduced Motion Options** for users with vestibular disorders
5. **Add High Contrast Mode** for users with low vision
6. **Create Comprehensive Keyboard Shortcuts** for power users
