# Test Environment Fix Summary

## Current Status

After extensive efforts to fix the test environment issues with TextEncoder/TextDecoder polyfills for MSW v2.0+, we've tried multiple approaches but have not yet found a solution that works with Create React App's test environment constraints.

## Approaches Attempted

### 1. Basic Polyfills in setupTests.js ❌
- Added custom MockTextEncoder and MockTextDecoder implementations
- Issue: MSW imports still ran before polyfills were initialized

### 2. Using text-encoding Package ❌
- Installed text-encoding npm package
- Created polyfills.js in src directory
- Required polyfills before all other imports
- Issue: Module resolution order in Create React App still caused TextEncoder to be undefined

### 3. Various Package.json Jest Configuration Attempts ❌
- Added setupFilesAfterEnv to package.json
- Created jest-setup.js at root
- Issue: Create React App restricts Jest configuration options

## Current Options

### Option 1: Mock Server Without MSW
We've created a simplified server-mock.js that provides basic mocking functionality without requiring MSW:
- Simulates the MSW API (listen, resetHandlers, close, use)
- Provides mock handlers with test data
- Avoids TextEncoder/TextDecoder dependency
- Trade-off: Less powerful than full MSW

### Option 2: Selective Component Testing
- Identify components that don't rely on API calls
- Create separate test suites that don't import MSW
- Run these tests first to validate the design system migration
- Trade-off: Incomplete test coverage

### Option 3: Eject from Create React App
- Run `npm run eject` to gain full control over the Jest configuration
- Set up proper polyfills with full control over load order
- Trade-off: One-way operation, increases maintenance complexity

## Recommendation

We recommend a two-phase approach:

1. **Immediate (Next 24 Hours)**:
   - Proceed with Option 1 (Mock Server Without MSW) to unblock testing
   - Create basic tests focusing on UI components that don't require API mocking
   - Document components that can't be fully tested with this approach

2. **Short-term (3-5 Days)**:
   - Prepare a proposal for Option 3 (Ejecting)
   - Outline the benefits, risks, and implementation plan
   - Get stakeholder approval before proceeding

## Next Steps

1. Implement the simplified server-mock.js approach
2. Update tests to use the mock server for components that need API requests
3. Start running basic UI tests that don't depend on API calls
4. Document all limitations and workarounds
5. Prepare ejection proposal if needed

This approach will allow us to make progress with validation while working toward a more comprehensive solution.
