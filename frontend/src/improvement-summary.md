   - Added loading state tracking for better user feedback

4. **Normalized Component Patterns**
   - Created ResourceLoader component for standardized loading/error states
   - Implemented skeleton loading for improved perceived performance
   - Added standardized empty state and error handling with retry

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Component Memoization**
   - Applied React.memo() to complex components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Implemented custom comparison functions for props to optimize rendering
   - Used useMemo() for expensive calculations and useCallback() for event handlers

2. **Component Extraction**
   - Split large components into smaller, focused components
   - Created reusable form components with memoization
   - Extracted UI components from logic components for better separation of concerns

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Added Web Vitals tracking (FCP, LCP, CLS, etc.)
   - Implemented lazy-loaded chunk size and loading time monitoring
   - Added route change performance tracking
   - Created component render time measurement utilities

## Docker Environment Improvements

1. **Runtime Environment Configuration System**
   - Implemented dynamic runtime environment variable injection
   - Created standardized API for accessing environment variables
   - Added automatic Docker environment detection
   - Supported environment-specific configuration

2. **Docker-Optimized Development Server**
   - Enhanced webpack dev server with Docker-specific optimizations
   - Configured proper file watching for Docker volumes
   - Implemented WebSocket configuration for hot module replacement
   - Added middleware for runtime environment and health checks

3. **Graceful Shutdown Handling**
   - Implemented signal handling (SIGTERM/SIGINT) for Docker orchestration
   - Added proper resource cleanup on container termination
   - Created connection tracking for WebSockets
   - Added timeout protection for shutdown procedures

4. **Health Check System**
   - Created comprehensive health check script for container orchestration
   - Added health check endpoint with detailed status reporting
   - Implemented process and resource monitoring
   - Added runtime environment verification

5. **Docker-Specific Error Handling**
   - Enhanced error reporting for containerized environments
   - Created fallback UI for critical errors in Docker
   - Added container-aware error logging
   - Implemented error metrics collection

## Accessibility Enhancements

1. **Accessibility Utilities**
   - Created comprehensive utility library (accessibilityUtils.js)
   - Implemented focus management hooks (useFocusTrap, useSkipNav)
   - Added screen reader announcement utilities
   - Created ARIA attribute helper functions
   - Added keyboard navigation helpers

2. **Component-Level Improvements**
   - Enhanced Button component with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard support
   - Updated modal components with focus trapping and proper labeling
   - Improved ErrorBoundary with accessible error messages and focus management
   - Added appropriate keyboard handlers throughout the application

3. **Application-Level Features**
   - Added skip navigation links for keyboard users
   - Created screen reader announcer for dynamic content changes
   - Implemented proper landmark structure with main content areas
   - Set proper document language and title management

4. **Testing and Documentation**
   - Created accessibility implementation documentation
   - Added unit tests for accessibility utilities
   - Updated project plan to include accessibility testing phase

## UI/UX Improvements

1. **Refactored Administrative Interfaces**
   - Enhanced TenantList and TenantsManager with ResourceContext
   - Added improved filtering and search capabilities
   - Implemented consistent grid/list view options

2. **Integration Flow Builder**
   - Optimized node components with memoization
   - Extracted smaller components for better performance
   - Added proper keyboard support for node manipulation

3. **Enhanced Form Components**
   - Updated InputField with validation patterns
   - Added accessible form controls with proper labeling
   - Implemented consistent error messaging

## Docker Runtime Environment Features

The Runtime Environment Configuration System provides a standardized way to manage environment-specific configuration in Docker containers:

1. **Dynamic Configuration**
   - Environment variables can be modified without rebuilding containers
   - Variables are injected at runtime into JavaScript environment
   - All configuration changes take effect immediately on container restart

2. **Standardized API**
   ```jsx
   // Import utilities
   import { getRuntimeEnv } from './utils/runtimeEnv';
   import { getEnvironmentVariable, getBooleanEnv, getNumericEnv } from './utils/environmentConfig';

   // Access environment variables with proper typing
   const apiUrl = getEnvironmentVariable('API_URL', '/api');  // String
   const debugEnabled = getBooleanEnv('DEBUG', false);        // Boolean
   const timeout = getNumericEnv('TIMEOUT', 30);              // Number

   // Check Docker environment
   import { isDocker } from './utils/environmentConfig';
   if (isDocker()) {
     console.log('Running in Docker container');
   }

   // Get environment-specific configuration
   import { getEnvironmentConfig } from './utils/environmentConfig';
   const config = getEnvironmentConfig();
   console.log(config.apiTimeout); // Value based on environment (dev, prod, etc.)
   ```

3. **Environment-Aware Configuration**
   - Automatic detection of Docker environment
   - Environment-specific configuration (development, testing, staging, production)
   - Type-safe environment variable access with fallbacks
   - Docker-specific configuration only available in containers

4. **Integration with Container Orchestration**
   - Proper health checks for orchestration platforms
   - Graceful handling of container start/stop signals
   - Resource cleanup on termination

## Next Steps

   - Implement template selection for new integrations
   - Add guided setup flows for common integration patterns
   - Enable saving custom integration as templates

2. **Enhanced Search Capabilities**
   - Add advanced search across all resources
   - Implement saved searches/filters
   - Add search history and suggestions

3. **Testing Expansion**
   - Implement comprehensive unit tests for all components
   - Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows
   - Set up automated accessibility testing with axe-core
   - Add visual regression testing

4. **Component Documentation**
   - Create detailed API documentation for all components
   - Add usage examples and pattern library
   - Document architectural decisions and patterns
