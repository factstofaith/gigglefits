- ðŸŸ¨ In Progress
- â¬œ Not Started

## Current Status

We've completed Phases 1-3, Phase 4, and made significant progress on Phase 5. The key architectural improvements (API service factory, context providers, component loading patterns) are now in place. We've successfully refactored all service layer files to use the API service factory pattern and have implemented key pages with our new architectural patterns. We are now making progress on Phase 6 by creating comprehensive component API documentation.

Most recently completed:
- ðŸŸ¨ Started comprehensive component API documentation:
  - Added JSDoc documentation to common components (SearchFilterPanel, AccessibilityTester, VirtualizedDataTable, etc.)
  - Added JSDoc documentation to integration components (IntegrationFlowCanvas, IntegrationCreationDialog)
  - Updated ComponentAPI.md with detailed component documentation
  - Following consistent documentation patterns with @component, @function, @param, @returns, and @example tags
- âœ… Implemented comprehensive accessibility improvements:
  - Created `accessibilityUtils.js` with focus management, keyboard navigation, and ARIA helpers
  - Enhanced common components (Button, Modal, ErrorBoundary) with accessibility features
  - Updated App.jsx with skip navigation and screen reader support
  - Created documentation for accessibility implementation
- âœ… Refactored integrationService.js, earningsService.js, and adminService.js to use API service factory
- âœ… Created IntegrationContext for integration data management
- âœ… Created EarningsContext for earnings data management
- âœ… Created ResourceLoader component for standardized loading states
- âœ… Implemented IntegrationDetailPageRefactored with the IntegrationContext
- âœ… Implemented EarningsPageRefactored with the EarningsContext

Next tasks:
- Continue component API documentation:
  - Complete documentation for remaining integration components (FieldMappingEditor, IntegrationTable, NodePropertiesPanel, etc.)
  - Start documenting admin components (ApplicationsManager, DatasetsManager, etc.)
  - Start documenting earnings components (EarningsCodeManager, EarningsMapEditor, etc.)
- Refactor AdminDashboardPage with ResourceContext
- Complete the EarningsMapEditor refactoring for improved mapping visualization
- Begin implementing the Integration Templates feature
- Begin adding comprehensive tests for the refactored components and services
- Set up automated accessibility testing with axe-core
