## Next Steps

❌ Validation checks failed. The following actions are recommended:

1. Address build errors first:
   - Fix syntax errors and type issues
   - Resolve missing dependencies
   - Correct import/export statements

2. Address test failures:
   - Fix broken component functionality
   - Update tests to match new component behavior
   - Check for missing mock data or services


After making fixes, run validation again to verify all issues are resolved.
