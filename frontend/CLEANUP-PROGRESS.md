# TAP Integration Platform Frontend Cleanup Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of the frontend codebase cleanup as part of the Phase 10 (Zero Technical Debt) initiative.

## Cleanup Goals
1. Organize project directories for better maintainability
2. Archive deprecated and unused components
3. Remove temporary build and fix scripts
4. Document design system components
5. Standardize file organization
6. Eliminate technical debt
7. Fix remaining build issues

## Progress

### Directory Organization
- [x] Created `archive` directory for deprecated files
- [x] Organized logs into `archive/logs`
- [x] Organized backups into `archive/backups`
- [x] Organized reports into `archive/reports`
- [x] Created structure for deprecated components in `archive/deprecated`

### Component Cleanup
- [x] Created design system cleanup process
- [x] Identified unused adapted components
- [x] Archived unused components
- [x] Updated index files to remove references to archived components
- [ ] Generate documentation for undocumented components

### Build Fixes
- [x] Fixed webpack configuration issues in env.js
- [x] Fixed webpack.config.js output configuration
- [x] Resolved import path issues
- [ ] Fix 31 remaining build errors

### Technical Debt
- [x] Fixed deeply nested code in components
- [x] Standardized context provider naming and exports
- [x] Improved error boundary implementation
- [ ] Fix 1 remaining hook violation
- [ ] Complete comprehensive test coverage

### Import Errors
- [x] Removed duplicate MUI imports
- [x] Fixed alias path inconsistencies
- [ ] Resolve remaining import issues

## Next Steps
1. âœ… Run the cleanup scripts to organize the project structure
2. Focus on fixing the import errors in design-system/optimized exports
   - Missing exports: Typography, Container, Paper, etc.
   - Update the design-system/optimized/index.js file to include all required components
3. Fix webpack configuration issue in src/config/index.js
   - Error: "Module parse failed: parser.destructuringAssignmentPropertiesFor is not a function"
   - Likely related to webpack DefinePlugin configuration
4. Fix the remaining hook violation
5. Run a complete build verification test
6. Create a production build to validate optimizations

## Execution Instructions
```bash
# From the frontend directory
cd scripts
./run-cleanup.sh
```

## Verification
After running the cleanup scripts, verify:
1. The project builds without errors: `npm run build`
2. All tests pass: `npm test`
3. There are no linting errors: `npm run lint`
4. The bundle size is optimized: `npm run analyze`

## Recent Changes (2025-03-29)
- Created cleanup scripts to automate organization
- Implemented design system component analysis
- Created directory structure for organizing deprecated files
- Added documentation report generation
