## ENFORCEMENT PHILOSOPHY
- **Complete System Approach**: All related issues are addressed holistically
- **Root Cause Resolution**: Fixing underlying architectural issues, not just symptoms
- **Parallel Build/Test Validation**: All changes validated against both build and test processes
- **Punt Strategy**: Each operation includes a detailed rollback and alternative plan
- **Technical Debt Prevention**: Rigorous validation ensures zero new issues
