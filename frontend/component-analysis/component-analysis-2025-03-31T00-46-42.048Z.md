## Recommendations

### Design System Compliance

61 components have design system issues. To fix:

1. Replace direct MUI imports with design system equivalents
2. Use adapted components from the design system
3. Update import statements to use design system paths
4. Consider creating a script to automatically convert direct imports

### Performance Improvements

1 components have potential performance issues. To improve:

1. Memoize expensive calculations with useMemo
2. Memoize callback functions with useCallback
3. Move object creation outside of render functions
4. Break down complex render functions into smaller components
5. Consider using React.memo for components that render often but with the same props

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Hook Violations**: Address all hook rule violations as they can cause unpredictable behavior
2. **Improve Design System Compliance**: Standardize component usage by migrating to design system components
3. **Optimize Performance**: Focus on high-complexity components and add memoization where appropriate
4. **Address Interdependent Issues**: Coordinate fixes for components that depend on each other
5. **Implement Static Analysis**: Add these checks to CI/CD to prevent regressions
