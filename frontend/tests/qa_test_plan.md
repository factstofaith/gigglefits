# QA Test Plan for Phase 2 Components

## Test Suite Overview

This comprehensive QA test plan outlines the testing approach for all Phase 2 components, including storage connectors, data sources, and file viewers. As this is a development-only application without production deployment concerns, we can implement robust testing strategies without legacy constraints, performance compromises, or compatibility limitations.

## Zero Technical Debt Testing Approach

Leveraging our development-only environment without production constraints, we will implement:

1. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Testing all component functionality without being limited by production data sensitivities or performance considerations
2. **Realistic Test Data**: Creating large, diverse datasets for thorough testing without production data privacy concerns
3. **Extensive Edge Case Testing**: Testing all possible failure modes and edge cases without limitations from existing production systems
4. **Advanced Testing Techniques**: Implementing property-based and generative testing without adaptation for legacy code
5. **Isolated Component Testing**: Testing components in isolation with comprehensive mocking without production service constraints
6. **End-to-End Flow Testing**: Testing complete user flows without production environment limitations
