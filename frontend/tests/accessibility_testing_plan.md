# Accessibility Testing Plan

## Overview

This comprehensive accessibility testing plan outlines the approach, tools, and methods for ensuring that all Phase 2 components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Leveraging our development-only environment without production constraints, we can implement thorough accessibility testing without legacy browser compatibility concerns or technical compromises.

## Zero Technical Debt Testing Approach

Our development-only environment allows us to:

1. **Implement Comprehensive Accessibility Testing**: Test all components against the latest WCAG standards without legacy browser constraints
2. **Use Advanced Testing Tools**: Leverage modern accessibility testing tools without compatibility concerns
3. **Automate Accessibility Checks**: Implement automated testing in CI/CD without existing pipeline limitations
4. **Fix Accessibility Issues Immediately**: Address issues without backward compatibility concerns
5. **Implement Advanced Accessibility Features**: Add enhanced accessibility features without legacy UI constraints

## Accessibility Standards

We will ensure all components meet or exceed the following standards:

1. **WCAG 2.1 Level AA Compliance**: Meeting all success criteria at Level AA
2. **Section 508 Compliance**: Ensuring conformance with U.S. federal requirements
3. **ADA Compliance**: Addressing Americans with Disabilities Act requirements
4. **WAI-ARIA Best Practices**: Following the latest WAI-ARIA authoring practices

  - Test complex widgets for appropriate screen reader interaction
- **Components to Test**:
  - Data tables and grid views
  - Form fields with validation
  - Interactive visualizations
  - Drag and drop interfaces
  - Notifications and alerts

#### 2.3 Color and Contrast Testing

- **Tools**: Color contrast analyzers, Grayscale mode testing
- **Methodology**:
  - Check all text against background colors
  - Test visual indicators that rely on color
  - Verify UI in grayscale mode
  - Check high contrast mode compatibility
- **Components to Test**:
  - Status indicators
  - Error and validation messages
  - Charts and visualizations
  - Interactive elements (buttons, links)
  - Form field states
