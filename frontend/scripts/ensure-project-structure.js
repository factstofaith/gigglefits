    content: `# Golden Approach Methodology

## Overview

The Golden Approach is a systematic methodology for implementing complex changes
in a codebase while ensuring safety, quality, and reversibility. It consists of
five key phases: Analysis, Strategy, Implementation, Verification, and Documentation.

## Principles

1. **Safety First**: All changes must be safe and reversible
2. **Alignment with Standards**: Follow project coding standards
3. **Technical Debt Avoidance**: Solve issues properly, not with workarounds
4. **Progressive Implementation**: Implement changes incrementally
5. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Document every aspect of the process
6. **Complete Resolution Over Expediency**: Proper fixes over quick workarounds

## Phases

### 1. Analysis Phase

- Understand the problem thoroughly
- Gather data and examples
- Identify patterns and edge cases
- Quantify the scope of the issue

### 2. Strategy Phase

- Develop a comprehensive plan
- Consider alternatives and trade-offs
- Break the solution into discrete steps
- Ensure the approach is reversible

### 3. Implementation Phase

- Proceed incrementally following the strategy
- Create specialized tools as needed
- Handle edge cases appropriately
- Maintain consistent coding standards

### 4. Verification Phase

- Test each step thoroughly
- Implement validation mechanisms
- Run comprehensive tests
- Verify against expected outcomes

### 5. Documentation Phase

- Document the analysis, strategy, and implementation
- Explain the rationale behind decisions
- Create usage guides for any tools created
- Update project documentation as needed

By following this Golden Approach, we ensure that complex changes are implemented
in a safe, systematic, and maintainable way.

    name: 'React18CompatibilityStrategy.md',
    content: `# React 18 Compatibility Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines our strategy for ensuring compatibility with React 18
while maintaining backward compatibility with existing components and libraries.

## Challenges

1. **Deprecated Lifecycle Methods**: React 18 has deprecated several lifecycle methods.
2. **Concurrent Rendering**: React 18 introduces concurrent rendering which can affect assumptions about rendering order.
3. **Third-party Library Compatibility**: Many third-party libraries have not been updated for React 18.
4. **Strict Mode Changes**: React 18's Strict Mode includes more checks and double-invokes methods.

## Strategy

### 1. Higher Order Component (HOC) Adapters

For third-party components with React 18 compatibility issues, we've implemented a
Higher Order Component (HOC) pattern with error boundaries. This approach:

- Wraps problematic components in a compatibility layer
- Catches and handles errors that might occur
- Provides graceful fallback when components fail
- Maintains the same API surface

### 2. Addressing Lifecycle Method Warnings

- Replace \`UNSAFE_componentWillMount\` with \`componentDidMount\`
- Replace \`UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps\` with \`getDerivedStateFromProps\`
- Replace \`UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate\` with \`getSnapshotBeforeUpdate\`

### 3. Adapter Components

We've created adapter components for specific third-party libraries with known
compatibility issues, such as:

- ReactJsonView
- ReactFlow
- Other problematic dependencies

These adapters handle the specific compatibility issues for each library.

### 4. Testing Strategy

- Test components with both production and development builds of React 18
- Verify behavior in both normal and strict mode
- Test edge cases that might be affected by concurrent rendering

## Implementation

Our implementation includes:

1. An analyzer script to identify components with potential compatibility issues
2. A generator for HOC adapters
3. Specialized adapters for specific third-party libraries
4. Integration tests to verify compatibility

## Conclusion

This strategy enables us to migrate to React 18 while maintaining compatibility
with existing code and third-party libraries. The HOC adapter pattern provides a
clean, maintainable approach to handling compatibility issues.

    name: 'SpecializedBuildStrategy.md',
    content: `# Specialized Build Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines our strategy for implementing a specialized build system
that supports multiple module formats (CommonJS and ESM) for better compatibility
across different environments.

## Challenges

1. **Module Format Compatibility**: Different environments require different module formats.
2. **Tree Shaking Support**: ESM modules enable better tree shaking.
3. **Dual Package Hazard**: Avoiding issues with multiple package representations.
4. **Configuration Complexity**: Managing multiple build configurations.

## Strategy

### 1. Multi-Format Build Configuration

We've implemented a specialized build system that:

- Builds both CommonJS and ESM versions of the code
- Uses the package.json "exports" field for format selection
- Maintains single source of truth with specialized configuration

### 2. Webpack Configuration for Different Targets

- Created specialized webpack configurations for each target format
- Optimized settings for each format
- Ensured proper handling of dependencies and externals

### 3. Package.json Configuration

Updated package.json with:
- "exports" field for conditional exports
- "main" field for CommonJS entry point
- "module" field for ESM entry point
- "types" field for TypeScript typings

### 4. Build Process

The build process:
1. Cleans the output directory
2. Builds CommonJS format
3. Builds ESM format
4. Copies type definitions
5. Generates a bundled version for direct browser use

## Implementation

Our implementation includes:

1. Specialized webpack configurations for each format
2. Build scripts to orchestrate the build process
3. Configuration for proper externalization of dependencies
4. Integration with existing build processes

## Benefits

This approach provides:

1. Better compatibility across different environments
2. Improved tree shaking for application code
3. Cleaner integration with modern build tools
4. Maintained backward compatibility

## Conclusion

The specialized build strategy ensures our code can be consumed in different
environments with optimal performance and compatibility, while maintaining a
clean development experience.

    name: 'SafeBuildErrorFixingStrategy.md',
    content: `# Safe Build Error Fixing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines our strategy for safely and systematically fixing build
errors while ensuring code quality and maintainability.

## Principles

1. **Understand Before Fixing**: Thoroughly understand the error before attempting to fix it.
2. **Categorize Errors**: Group similar errors for systematic fixing.
3. **Fix Root Causes**: Address the root cause, not just the symptoms.
4. **Progressive Verification**: Verify fixes incrementally.
5. **Maintain Coding Standards**: Ensure fixes adhere to project coding standards.
6. **Document Patterns**: Document error patterns and fix strategies.

## Error Categories

We've identified several categories of build errors:

1. **TypeScript Errors**: Issues with types, syntactic constructs, etc.
2. **Import/Export Errors**: Issues with module imports/exports.
3. **Compatibility Errors**: Issues with library compatibility.
4. **Syntax Errors**: Issues with JavaScript/JSX syntax.
5. **Configuration Errors**: Issues with build configuration.

## Fix Strategy

### 1. Analysis Phase

- Run build with detailed error reporting
- Parse and categorize errors
- Identify patterns and high-impact files
- Create analysis documentation

### 2. Implementation Phase

For each error category:

1. Create specialized fix scripts
2. Apply fixes to high-impact files first
3. Verify after each batch of fixes
4. Document the fix approach

### 3. Verification Phase

- Run full build process
- Run comprehensive tests
- Verify fix doesn't introduce regressions
- Document remaining issues if any

### 4. Documentation Phase

- Document error patterns
- Document fix strategies
- Create prevention guidelines
- Update project documentation

## Tools

We've created several tools to assist in this process:

1. **error-analyzer.js**: Analyzes and categorizes build errors
2. **fix-typescript-errors.js**: Fixes common TypeScript errors
3. **fix-template-literals.js**: Fixes template literal syntax issues
4. **fix-imports.js**: Fixes import statement issues

## Conclusion

This systematic approach allows us to fix build errors safely and effectively,
ensuring high code quality and maintainability.
