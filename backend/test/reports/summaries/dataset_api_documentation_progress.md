   - Provided example response with realistic dataset data
   - Documented error responses (401, 403)

2. **POST /api/admin/datasets**
   - Enhanced with detailed operation description
   - Added request body example with schema fields

- System fields with appropriate timestamps and IDs
- Error response examples for different status codes
- Consistent format across all dataset endpoints

Example dataset response:
```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Customer Data",
    "description": "Core customer data with personal and contact information",
    "schema": [
        {
            "name": "customer_id",
            "description": "Unique identifier for the customer",
            "type": "string",
            "required": true,
            "is_primary_key": true,
            "example_value": "CUST-12345",
            "validation_pattern": "^CUST-[0-9]{5}$"
        },
        {
            "name": "first_name",
            "description": "Customer's first name",
            "type": "string",
            "required": true
        },
        {
            "name": "last_name",
            "description": "Customer's last name",
            "type": "string",
            "required": true
        },
        {
            "name": "email",
            "description": "Customer's email address",
            "type": "string",
            "required": true,
            "format": "email"
        },
        {
            "name": "date_of_birth",
            "description": "Customer's date of birth",
            "type": "date",
            "required": false
        }
    ],
    "status": "active",
    "discovery_method": "manual",
    "source_application_id": 1,
    "created_at": "2025-01-20T14:30:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-03-10T09:45:00Z",
    "created_by": "user-uuid-12345"
}
```

### Parameter Documentation

Enhanced documentation for dataset endpoint parameters:

1. **Path Parameters**:
   - dataset_id: Documented with constraints (gt=0) and description

2. **Query Parameters**:
   - skip: Documented with constraints (ge=0) and pagination explanation
   - limit: Documented with constraints (ge=1, le=1000) and usage description
   - status: Documented with filtering explanation
   - application_id: Documented with relationship explanation

3. **Request Body**:
   - Added detailed example for DatasetCreate
   - Documented schema field requirements
   - Added type information and constraints

### Enhanced Docstrings

Added comprehensive docstrings to dataset endpoint functions:

1. **get_datasets**:
   ```python
   """
   Retrieve a list of all datasets in the platform.
   
   This endpoint allows super administrators to:
   * List all registered datasets
   * Filter datasets by status or source application
   * Paginate through the results
   
   The response includes the full dataset information including schema details.
   Datasets represent the data structures available for integration flows
   and are typically associated with a source application.
   
   This operation requires super admin privileges.
   """
   ```

2. **create_dataset**:
   ```python
   """
   Register a new dataset in the system.
   
   This endpoint allows super administrators to create new dataset 
   registrations in the platform. Datasets define the data structure
   available for integration flows and transformations.
   
   The dataset must include:
   * A unique name within the platform
   * A schema that defines the fields and their data types
   * An association with a source application (optional)
   
   The schema defines the structure of the data, including field names,
   data types, constraints, and relationships. Each field can specify
   whether it's required, a primary key, and include validation patterns.
   
   This operation requires super admin privileges.
   """
   ```

3. **get_dataset**:
   ```python
   """
   Retrieve detailed information about a specific dataset by its ID.
   
   This endpoint provides super administrators with access to the full
   details of a dataset, including:
   
   * Basic information (name, description, status)
   * Complete schema definition with all fields
   * Source application association
   * Creation and update timestamps
   * Creator information
   
   The schema contains the detailed structure of the dataset, including
   field definitions with data types, constraints, and metadata.
   
   If the dataset ID does not exist, a 404 Not Found response is returned.
   
   This operation requires super admin privileges.
   """
   ```

## Integration with API Documentation

The enhanced dataset endpoints are now fully documented in the OpenAPI/Swagger interface, providing:

1. **Improved API Discoverability**:
   - API consumers can easily understand dataset operations
   - Relationships between applications and datasets are clearly explained
   - Schema structure is detailed with field-level information

2. **Comprehensive Request/Response Documentation**:
   - Request format examples guide API consumers
   - Response examples show expected data structure
   - Error responses clarify potential issues

3. **Parameter Validation Documentation**:
   - Constraints are clearly documented (min/max values)
   - Required vs. optional parameters are distinguished
   - Data formatting requirements are explained

## Status and Next Steps

Current documentation status for dataset endpoints:

- GET /api/admin/datasets - Fully documented (100%)
- POST /api/admin/datasets - Fully documented (100%)
- GET /api/admin/datasets/{dataset_id} - Fully documented (100%)
- PUT /api/admin/datasets/{dataset_id} - Not yet documented (0%)
- DELETE /api/admin/datasets/{dataset_id} - Not yet documented (0%)

Next steps for dataset API documentation:

1. Complete documentation for remaining dataset endpoints:
   - PUT /api/admin/datasets/{dataset_id} (update dataset)
   - DELETE /api/admin/datasets/{dataset_id} (delete dataset)
   - Schema discovery and dataset creation from schema endpoints

2. Document dataset relationship endpoints:
   - Dataset-tenant associations
   - Dataset-application associations
   - Field mapping endpoints

3. Add schema validation examples:
   - Document how field validation works
   - Add examples of validation patterns
   - Document error responses for validation failures

## Conclusion

The dataset API documentation has been significantly enhanced with comprehensive endpoint documentation, detailed examples, and thorough docstrings. The documentation provides clear guidance on how to work with datasets in the TAP Integration Platform, including creating datasets, retrieving dataset information, and understanding the schema structure.
