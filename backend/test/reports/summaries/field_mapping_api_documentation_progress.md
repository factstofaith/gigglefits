# Field Mapping and Storage Configuration API Documentation Progress

## Summary
This document tracks the progress of API documentation for field mapping and storage configuration endpoints in the TAP Integration Platform.

## Field Mapping Endpoints Documentation Status

| Endpoint | HTTP Method | Path | Status | Notes |
|----------|-------------|------|--------|-------|
| Get Field Mappings | GET | `/api/integrations/{integration_id}/mappings` | ✅ Completed | Enhanced with comprehensive response examples, detailed parameter descriptions, and proper error response documentation |
| Create Field Mapping | POST | `/api/integrations/{integration_id}/mappings` | ✅ Completed | Added detailed request body example, response examples, and documentation of access control |
| Update Field Mapping | PUT | `/api/integrations/{integration_id}/mappings/{mapping_id}` | ✅ Completed | Added comprehensive examples for transformation parameters and detailed documentation of update considerations |
| Delete Field Mapping | DELETE | `/api/integrations/{integration_id}/mappings/{mapping_id}` | ✅ Completed | Added detailed documentation of deletion implications and proper error response documentation |

## Azure Blob Storage Configuration Endpoints Documentation Status

| Endpoint | HTTP Method | Path | Status | Notes |
|----------|-------------|------|--------|-------|
| Get Azure Blob Config | GET | `/api/integrations/{integration_id}/azure-blob-config` | ✅ Completed | Enhanced with detailed response examples and explanation of configuration parameters |
| Update Azure Blob Config | PUT | `/api/integrations/{integration_id}/azure-blob-config` | ✅ Completed | Added comprehensive configuration validation and usage guidelines, security considerations, and response examples |
| Test Azure Blob Connection | POST | `/api/integrations/{integration_id}/azure-blob-config/test` | ✅ Completed | Added multiple examples of success and error scenarios, detailed troubleshooting guidance, and connection validation steps |

## Schedule Configuration Endpoints Documentation Status

| Endpoint | HTTP Method | Path | Status | Notes |
|----------|-------------|------|--------|-------|
| Get Schedule Config | GET | `/api/integrations/{integration_id}/schedule` | ✅ Completed | Added comprehensive examples of all schedule types including daily, weekly, monthly, hourly, and on-demand schedules with timezone information |
| Update Schedule Config | PUT | `/api/integrations/{integration_id}/schedule` | ✅ Completed | Added detailed validation rules, parameter requirements, and examples for each schedule type, along with error responses and timezone handling |

## Completion Statistics
- Field Mapping Endpoints: 4/4 (100%)
- Azure Blob Storage Configuration Endpoints: 3/3 (100%)
- Schedule Configuration Endpoints: 2/2 (100%)
- Overall Configuration Endpoints: 9/9 (100%)

## Next Steps
1. Document dataset association endpoints with detailed examples and parameter descriptions
2. Document earnings mapping endpoints with comprehensive transformation examples
3. Update cross-references in docstrings between related endpoint groups
4. Create reusable documentation components for common parameters and response patterns
5. Consolidate documentation tags for improved organization in OpenAPI

## Implementation Notes
- Added proper OpenAPI tag grouping ("integration-mappings", "integration-storage", and "integration-scheduling")
- Enhanced error response documentation with realistic examples of various error conditions
- Added detailed docstrings explaining the purpose and usage of each endpoint
- Added comprehensive parameter descriptions to improve API discoverability
- Included detailed transformation examples to assist in proper API usage
- Used multiple response examples for endpoints with complex return scenarios
- Added validation rules and parameter requirements for each endpoint
- Implemented consistent tagging and response formatting across endpoint groups
- Added timezone handling details and format specifications
- Enhanced security and access control documentation
