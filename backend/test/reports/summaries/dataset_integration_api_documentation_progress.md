# Dataset Integration API Documentation Progress

## Summary
This document tracks the progress of API documentation for dataset integration endpoints in the TAP Integration Platform.

## Dataset Integration Endpoints Documentation Status

| Endpoint | HTTP Method | Path | Status | Notes |
|----------|-------------|------|--------|-------|
| Get Integration Datasets | GET | `/api/integrations/{integration_id}/datasets` | ✅ Completed | Enhanced with detailed dataset examples including fields, improved descriptions, and proper error responses |
| Associate Dataset | POST | `/api/integrations/{integration_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}` | ✅ Completed | Added comprehensive error examples, detailed parameter descriptions, and explanation of association behaviors |
| Disassociate Dataset | DELETE | `/api/integrations/{integration_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}` | ✅ Completed | Added detailed documentation of disassociation implications, conflict scenarios, and proper error handling |

## Dataset Discovery Endpoints Documentation Status

| Endpoint | HTTP Method | Path | Status | Notes |
|----------|-------------|------|--------|-------|
| Discover Fields | GET | `/api/integrations/{integration_id}/discover-fields` | ✅ Completed | Added comprehensive source and destination field examples, detailed parameter validation, and extensive error handling documentation |

## Completion Statistics
- Dataset Integration Endpoints: 3/3 (100%)
- Dataset Discovery Endpoints: 1/1 (100%)
- Overall Dataset-Related Endpoints: 4/4 (100%)

## Next Steps
1. Update integration context docstrings to reference dataset associations
2. Create cross-references between field mappings and datasets documentation
3. Consider adding schema validation endpoint documentation
4. Enhance examples with more diverse dataset structures
5. Document additional dataset discovery scenarios for different system types

## Implementation Notes
- Added proper OpenAPI tag grouping with new "integration-datasets" tag
- Enhanced error response documentation with multiple examples for different scenarios
- Added detailed docstrings explaining the purpose and behavior of dataset associations
- Implemented proper parameter validation and documentation
- Included important considerations and implications for dataset operations
- Added comprehensive response examples with realistic dataset field structures
- Added proper cross-referencing between related endpoint groups
