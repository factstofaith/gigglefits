# Earnings Mapping API Documentation Progress

## Summary
This document tracks the progress of API documentation for earnings mapping endpoints in the TAP Integration Platform.

## Earnings Mapping Endpoints Documentation Status

| Endpoint | HTTP Method | Path | Status | Notes |
|----------|-------------|------|--------|-------|
| Get Earnings Mappings | GET | `/api/integrations/{integration_id}/earnings/mappings` | ✅ Completed | Enhanced with detailed examples of various earnings code mappings, added multiplier explanation, and improved documentation of mapping types |
| Create Earnings Mapping | POST | `/api/integrations/{integration_id}/earnings/mappings` | ✅ Completed | Added comprehensive validation rules, detailed examples with rate multipliers, and proper error response documentation |
| Update Earnings Mapping | PUT | `/api/integrations/{integration_id}/earnings/mappings/{mapping_id}` | ✅ Completed | Enhanced with detailed validation rules for updates, documented uniqueness constraints, and added clear examples of partial updates |
| Delete Earnings Mapping | DELETE | `/api/integrations/{integration_id}/earnings/mappings/{mapping_id}` | ✅ Completed | Added detailed documentation of deletion implications, default mapping considerations, and proper error handling including conflict scenarios |

## Earnings Code Management Endpoints Documentation Status

| Endpoint | HTTP Method | Path | Status | Notes |
|----------|-------------|------|--------|-------|
| Get Earnings Codes | GET | `/api/integrations/earnings/codes` | ✅ Completed | Added comprehensive examples of various earnings code types, tenant filtering, and destination system filtering |
| Create Earnings Code | POST | `/api/integrations/earnings/codes` | ✅ Completed | Added detailed validation rules, examples for various earnings types, and error response documentation |
| Update Earnings Code | PUT | `/api/integrations/earnings/codes/{code_id}` | ✅ Completed | Enhanced with validation rules, partial update examples, and special considerations for code changes |

## Completion Statistics
- Earnings Mapping Endpoints: 4/4 (100%)
- Earnings Code Management Endpoints: 3/3 (100%)
- Overall Earnings-Related Endpoints: 7/7 (100%)

## Next Steps
1. Add cross-references between earnings mappings and field mappings documentation
2. Enhance documentation with payroll system-specific considerations
3. Update integration docstrings to reference earnings mapping capabilities 
4. Develop examples of complex earnings mapping scenarios
5. Create visual documentation of earnings mapping workflows

## Implementation Notes
- Added proper OpenAPI tag grouping with new "integration-earnings" tag
- Enhanced error response documentation with multiple examples for different scenarios
- Added detailed docstrings explaining the purpose and behavior of earnings code mappings
- Implemented proper validation rules documentation with examples
- Added comprehensive explanation of multiplier usage and priority ordering
- Highlighted default mapping behavior and implications
- Ensured consistent documentation format across all earnings-related endpoints
