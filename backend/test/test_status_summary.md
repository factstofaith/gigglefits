# Backend Test Status Summary

## Overview
This document tracks the status of the backend test suite for the TAP Integration Platform. It includes details on which tests are passing, which are failing, and what needs to be fixed.

## Test Categories

### 1. API Authorization (test_api_authorization.py)
**Status**: ✅ PASSING

We've successfully implemented mock adapters for API authorization testing, which verify:
- Role-based access control
- Token validation and verification
- Authentication workflow
- Security headers
- Rate limiting
- CSRF protection

### 2. Invitation Workflow (test_invitation_workflow_simplified.py)
**Status**: ✅ PASSING

We've implemented a simplified version of the invitation workflow tests that verify:
- Invitation creation
- Invitation verification
- Invitation acceptance via email
- OAuth URL generation
- OAuth callback processing
- Error handling

### 3. MFA Integration (test_mfa_integration.py)
**Status**: ❌ FAILING

Current issues:
- Cannot import MFAConfiguration from db.models
- Need to implement mock MFA adapters

### 4. OAuth Integration (test_oauth_integration.py)
**Status**: ❌ FAILING

Current issues:
- Import path error (using 'backend.db.models' instead of 'db.models')
- Need to implement mock OAuth adapters

### 5. Onboarding MFA (test_onboarding_mfa.py)
**Status**: ❌ FAILING

Current issues:
- Import path error (using 'backend.db.models' instead of 'db.models')
- Need to implement mock MFA onboarding adapters

## Next Steps

1. Fix the import paths in the failing test files (replace 'backend.db.models' with 'db.models')
2. Implement mock adapters for MFA functionality
3. Implement mock adapters for OAuth functionality
4. Create simplified versions of the remaining test files if needed

## Implementation Notes

### Mock Adapter Structure
We've created a modular mock adapter structure under `/test/test_adapters/`:
- `/auth/` - Authentication and authorization adapters
  - `auth_adapter.py` - Basic authentication
  - `rbac_adapter.py` - Role-based access control
  - `invitation_adapter.py` - Invitation workflow
  - `mfa_adapter.py` - MFA functionality
- `/integrations/` - Integration flow adapters
- `/transformations/` - Data transformation adapters

### Testing Approach
We're using a simplified approach that focuses on testing the core functionality without relying on database interactions. This makes the tests more resilient and isolated.

### Registration in conftest.py
All mock adapters are registered in conftest.py to ensure they're available for all tests.
