## Dockerfile Type Details

- **Environment:** Production
- **Component:** Frontend

## Detected Frameworks

- **Nginx**
- **Node**
- **Webpack**

## Optimization Recommendations

### 1. Copying specific files instead of entire directory (ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM)

- **Lines:** 19
- **Category:** build-speed
- **Recommendation:** Consider optimizing this pattern for better Docker layer caching

### 2. Grouping ENV instructions (ðŸ”µ LOW)

- **Lines:** 25
- **Category:** layer-count-optimization
- **Recommendation:** Group multiple ENV instructions into a single layer


## Optimized Dockerfile Example

```dockerfile
# Optimized Frontend Production Dockerfile for TAP Integration Platform
# Generated by docker-layer-optimizer-enhanced.js

# Stage 1: Build the application
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app
RUN chown -R node:node /app
USER node

# Install build dependencies
RUN apk add --no-cache python3 make g++

# Copy package files for dependency caching
COPY --chown=node:node package.json package-lock.json* ./

# Install dependencies with clean npm ci for more consistent builds
RUN npm ci

# Copy application code
COPY --chown=node:node . .

# Ensure webpack config directory exists
RUN mkdir -p /app/config

# Set production environment
ENV NODE_ENV=production

# Create a production build using webpack
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Create the production image with NGINX
FROM nginx:alpine AS production

# Copy compiled app from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy nginx configuration
COPY ./nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Setup runtime environment variable support
RUN echo '#!/bin/sh
# Generate runtime environment variables for frontend
cat > /usr/share/nginx/html/runtime-env.js << EOF
window.runtimeEnv = {
  BACKEND_URL: "${BACKEND_URL:-http://backend:8000}",
  API_URL: "${API_URL:-http://backend:8000/api/v1}",
  NODE_ENV: "production",
  ENVIRONMENT: "production"
};
EOF
' > /docker-entrypoint.d/30-runtime-env.sh && chmod +x /docker-entrypoint.d/30-runtime-env.sh

# Add health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=5s --start-period=10s --retries=3 CMD curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1

# Expose the NGINX port
EXPOSE 80

# NGINX container automatically starts nginx when the container is run
```

## Optimization Explanation

The optimized Dockerfile implements the following best practices:

1. **Dependency Caching** - Package files (package.json, requirements.txt) are copied before other source files to leverage Docker layer caching. When dependencies don't change, these layers can be reused.

2. **Multi-Stage Builds** - For production builds, separate stages are used for building and running the application, resulting in smaller final images.

3. **Layer Optimization** - Commands are grouped to reduce the number of layers, and cleanup commands are included in the same layer as installation commands.

4. **Health Checks** - Proper HEALTHCHECK instructions are added to allow container orchestration systems to monitor container health.

5. **Environment Variables** - Environment variables are grouped in a single layer for better readability and layer count optimization.

6. **Entrypoint Scripts** - Proper entrypoint scripts are used for initialization tasks, providing more flexibility and better error handling.

7. **Build Arguments** - Build arguments are used where appropriate to allow customization during build time.

8. **Security Considerations** - Non-root users are used where appropriate, and permissions are properly set.

## Implementation Recommendations

1. Review the optimized Dockerfile and adjust according to your specific project requirements.
2. Test the optimized Dockerfile in your development environment before using in production.
3. Consider implementing Docker Compose volume mounts for development to improve developer experience.
4. Use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files from the build context.
