# TAP Integration Platform Standardization Implementation Checklist

This checklist is the source of truth for implementation status, providing detailed steps to standardize the TAP Integration Platform codebase. We're following a dev-to-prod approach with no concerns for active production environments, focusing on root cause analysis and using the `p_tools/docker` tools to automate fixes and validate changes. We are keeping this file implementation-checklist.md and project.plan.md update with our progress which is located at tap-integration-platform\golden-folder. We are never doing work arounds. When we modify p_tools\docker tools we are trying to keep the files smaller than 500 lines and modular. Our overall goal is to achieve 100% code standardization with a successful build of the npm. You are to update the trackers after successful task completion and verify next steps.
