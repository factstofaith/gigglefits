1. Update Babel configuration to use `@babel/preset-env` with `useBuiltIns: "usage"`
2. Remove unnecessary polyfill packages from dependencies
3. Remove unnecessary polyfill imports from source files
4. Add targeted polyfills only for browsers that need them
5. Run the build and test process to verify everything works correctly
