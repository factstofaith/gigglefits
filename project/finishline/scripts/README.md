# Project Optimization Tools

This directory contains a suite of tools designed to optimize and standardize the frontend codebase. These tools help track progress, ensure quality, and facilitate smooth transitions between development phases.

## Available Tools

### Phase Automator

The Phase Automator is a powerful tool that automatically implements components, tests, and documentation for each project phase, dramatically accelerating the development process.

Usage:
```bash
./scripts/project-tools.js automate <phase>
```

The Phase Automator will:
1. Generate all required components for the specified phase
2. Create comprehensive tests (unit, visual, and accessibility)
3. Set up documentation and Storybook integration
4. Implement phase-specific utilities

This tool is designed to eliminate technical debt by ensuring all components follow standardized patterns and have complete test coverage from the start.

### Project Tools CLI

The main entry point for all optimization tools is the `project-tools.js` script. This provides a unified command-line interface for running all project optimization tools.

Usage:
```bash
./scripts/project-tools.js <command> [options]
```

Available commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `analyze` | Analyze the current project phase or a specific phase |
| `transition` | Prepare for transition to the next phase or a specific phase |
| `dashboard` | Generate quality metrics dashboard |
| `automate` | **NEW:** Automate implementation of a project phase |
| `status` | Show current project status and next steps |
| `help` | Show help information |

### Phase Analyzer

Analyzes project progress, identifies areas for improvement, and generates recommendations for the current phase.

Usage:
```bash
./scripts/project-tools.js analyze [phase]
```

The analyzer will:
1. Check requirements for the specified phase (or the current phase if not specified)
2. Verify success criteria for the phase
3. Generate specific recommendations for completing the phase
4. Create a detailed markdown report

### Phase Transition Optimizer

Facilitates smooth transitions between phases by verifying requirements, generating documentation, creating example implementations, and setting up infrastructure for the next phase.

Usage:
```bash
./scripts/project-tools.js transition [fromPhase] [toPhase]
```

The transition optimizer will:
1. Run checks to verify the source phase is complete
2. Set up the necessary infrastructure for the target phase
3. Generate comprehensive documentation for the transition
4. Create example implementations for the new phase

### Quality Metrics Dashboard

Generates comprehensive quality metrics reports for the project, tracking test coverage, bundle size, performance metrics, accessibility compliance, and technical debt.

Usage:
```bash
./scripts/project-tools.js dashboard
```

The dashboard generator will:
1. Collect metrics across different categories
2. Calculate an overall health score for the project
3. Generate specific recommendations for improvement
4. Create both HTML and markdown reports

## Development Phases

The tools track project progress through the following phases:

1. **Foundation Setup**: Project structure, webpack configuration, ESM/CJS builds
2. **Component Standardization**: Core UI components, standardized patterns
3. **State Management and Hooks**: Context providers, custom hooks, services
4. **Performance Optimization**: Bundle analysis, code splitting, rendering optimizations
5. **Testing and Quality**: Component tests, visual regression, E2E testing
6. **Accessibility and Documentation**: A11y components, Storybook, developer tools
7. **Advanced Optimizations**: Caching, PWA features, module federation

## Getting Started

To check your current project status:

```bash
./scripts/project-tools.js status
```

This will show you the current phase, completion percentage, and specific next steps to make progress.
