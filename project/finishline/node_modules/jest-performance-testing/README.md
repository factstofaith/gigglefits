**Note**: If you are using TypeScript, we are recommending to import this lib in local file like `*.test.ts | *.spec.ts`. This is because, we have expanded [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) types, so global types are not recognized by some editors if you import this lib in setup file. If you want to import this lib in setup file, please see here [testing-library/jest-dom#123 (comment)](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom/issues/123#issuecomment-526518629).

### toBeMounted

`toBeMounted()`

This matcher is to check if component is mounted.

```js

```js
expect(renderTime.current.Component).toBeMounted();
```

### toBeMountedWithin

`toBeMountedWithin(mountedTime: number)`

This matcher is to check if mounted time is less than expected time.

```js
expect(renderTime.current.Component).toBeMountedWithin(16); // ms
```

### toBeUpdatedWithin

`toBeUpdatedWithin(updatedTime: number[])`

This matcher is to check if some updated time are less than expected time.

```js
expect(renderTime.current.Component).toBeUpdatedWithin([
  10, // first render
  15, // second render
  20, // third render
]);
```

If you have same render time, you can write as bellow.

```js
// All items are 16ms
expect(renderTime.current.Component).toBeUpdatedWithin(16);
```

### toBeRenderedTimes
