## How to Update This Tracker

1. Mark tasks as completed by changing `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for completed items
2. Update the Tasks Completed count in the summary tracker at the top
3. Update the progress bars by changing □ to ■ in the completed portions
4. Update the total project progress percentage
5. Update the Risk Monitoring status as needed:
   - 🟢 Low Risk
   - 🟡 Moderate Risk
   - 🔴 High Risk
6. Update milestone status as phases progress:
   - 🔴 Not Started
   - 🟡 In Progress
   - 🟢 Completed
7. Update the "Current Phase" indicator to reflect the active phase
8. Document any zero technical debt advantages realized during implementation

Throughout the project, maintain focus on the development-only nature and zero technical debt approach by:
- Selecting ideal technologies without backward compatibility concerns
- Implementing optimal architectures without migration complexity
- Creating comprehensive tests without legacy code constraints
- Documenting all components without retrofit documentation concerns
- Refactoring aggressively whenever beneficial without migration paths
