#### Core Implementation Files:

- `/frontend/src/utils/performance/performanceMonitor.js`: The core implementation of the performance monitoring system with metrics tracking, analysis, and reporting capabilities.

### 3. User Interface Components

A suite of user interface components for visualizing and interacting with performance data:

#### Key Components:

- **PerformanceBudgetPanel**: A comprehensive dashboard for:
  - Visualizing budget violations

  - Setting and adjusting performance budgets

- **PerformanceIndicator**: A compact status indicator for:
  - Showing overall performance health
  - Providing quick access to performance tools
  - Displaying violation counts
  - Toggling monitoring features

- **PerformanceMonitoringProvider**: A context provider for:
  - Centralizing performance monitoring state
  - Enabling/disabling monitoring
  - Sharing performance data across components
  - Managing monitoring lifecycle

#### Core Implementation Files:

- `/frontend/src/components/common/PerformanceBudgetPanel.jsx`: The performance budget visualization dashboard.
- `/frontend/src/components/common/performance/PerformanceIndicator.jsx`: The compact performance status indicator.
- `/frontend/src/components/common/performance/PerformanceMonitoringProvider.jsx`: The context provider for performance monitoring.

### 4. Hook-Based API

A set of React hooks for easily integrating performance monitoring and budgets:

#### Key Hooks:

- **usePerformanceBudget**: A hook for:
  - Monitoring budget violations
  - Reacting to performance issues
  - Customizing budget thresholds
  - Tracking component-specific violations

- **usePerformanceMonitoring**: A hook for:
  - Accessing performance monitoring state
  - Controlling monitoring features
  - Generating performance reports
  - Checking current performance status

#### Core Implementation Files:

- `/frontend/src/hooks/performance/usePerformanceBudget.js`: The hook implementation for working with performance budgets.
- `/frontend/src/hooks/performance/index.js`: The index file re-exporting all performance-related hooks.

## Benefits of Zero Technical Debt Approach

## Integration with Existing System

The performance monitoring system has been integrated with the existing codebase, providing immediate value without disrupting current functionality:

1. **Non-Intrusive Monitoring**:
   - Added performance tracking with minimal impact on existing components
   - Implemented budget enforcement without breaking changes to component API
   - Created toggle mechanisms for enabling/disabling monitoring as needed

2. **Opt-In Integration**:
