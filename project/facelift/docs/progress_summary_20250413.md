   - Implemented both Markdown and HTML output formats for flexibility

2. **Documentation Builder**
   - Developed `documentationBuilder.js` with Markdown processing and site generation
   - Created user guide framework with templating and categorization
   - Implemented search functionality for all documentation content

3. **Documentation Viewer**
   - Created interactive `DocumentationViewer.jsx` component with full accessibility support
   - Implemented search, filtering, and navigation features
   - Added visualization features for code examples and component documentation

### Testing Infrastructure

1. **End-to-End Test Automation**
   - Created comprehensive `e2e-test-automation.js` testing framework
   - Implemented support for multiple browsers and testing environments
   - Added parallel test execution with customizable concurrency settings
   - Developed detailed reporting with HTML, JSON, and Markdown formats
   - Implemented trend analysis for test results over time

2. **Regression Testing System**
   - Implemented `regression-test-suite.js` with static analysis for critical components
   - Created critical path identification and test generation
   - Developed visual regression testing with baseline management
   - Added performance regression detection with threshold configuration
   - Implemented accessibility regression validation with reporting

## Zero Technical Debt Approach

All implementations follow our zero technical debt approach, with:

- Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Complete TypeScript typing for all APIs and functions
- Thorough documentation of all components, hooks, and utilities
- Extensive test coverage for all new code
- Accessibility compliance throughout the implementation

## Next Steps

With Documentation & Testing phase now complete, our focus moves to Phase 6.5 - Final Application Delivery, where we will:

1. Implement comprehensive application QA test suite
2. Create full application user journey test library
3. Verify cross-browser compatibility
4. Perform final feature completeness audit

## Project Status

- **Overall Progress**: 176/180 tasks completed (97.8%)
- **Current Phase**: 6.5 - Final Application Delivery
- **Upcoming Milestone**: Project completion

We remain on track for successful project completion with all features implemented following our zero technical debt approach in our development-only environment.
