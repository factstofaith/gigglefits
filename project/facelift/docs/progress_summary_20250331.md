   - Built comprehensive utilities without compatibility layer complexity

## Accessibility Implementation Update

Our accessibility implementation (Phase 6.2) has been fully completed with all components integrated:

1. **Visualization Components Integration**:
   - Completed `A11yFlowCanvas` implementation with keyboard navigation
   - Finished `A11yDataChart` with screen reader support
   - Integrated `A11yTreeView` with accessible alternatives
   - Added text descriptions for all complex visualizations
   - Implemented keyboard navigation for interactive elements

2. **Accessibility Hook Usage**:
   - Applied `useA11yKeyboard` for comprehensive keyboard navigation
