# TAP Integration Platform - UI Facelift Project Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive, phased approach to audit and enhance the UI of the TAP Integration Platform, following the Golden Approach coding practices. The objective is to create a robust, user-friendly interface that allows users to easily build integrations without developer intervention, enabling them to add datasets to applications, transform data, map fields, configure notifications, schedule runs, and test integrations entirely through the UI.

This project will be implemented with a **zero technical debt approach** in a **development-only environment** without production deployment or database migration concerns. This provides us with the freedom to implement optimal solutions without legacy constraints while adhering to software engineering best practices.

## Main Application Objective

- Easy building of integrations with UI only, eliminating the need for developers
- Adding and managing applications and datasets with an intuitive interface
- Building integrations by adding multiple sources and destinations within a single flow

## Conclusion

This project plan provides a structured approach to achieving the objectives of enhancing the TAP Integration Platform UI with zero technical debt. By leveraging the development-only nature of this application, we can focus on implementing best practices without production deployment or database migration constraints.

Following this phased implementation, we will deliver a comprehensive solution that allows both administrators and standard users to easily build integrations without developer intervention. The platform will support multiple sources and destinations, comprehensive transformation capabilities, and robust management features, all while maintaining the Golden Approach coding practices for high-quality, maintainable code.

By embracing a zero technical debt approach from the beginning, we ensure that the application remains maintainable, extensible, and performant throughout its lifecycle, avoiding the accumulation of shortcuts or workarounds that would otherwise require future refactoring.
