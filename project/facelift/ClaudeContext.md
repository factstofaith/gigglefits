# TAP Integration Platform UI Facelift - Claude Context

## Project Overview

The TAP Integration Platform UI Facelift project involves implementing a comprehensive user interface enhancement for the existing integration platform. The application allows users to build integrations without developer intervention, enabling them to add datasets to applications, transform data, map fields, configure notifications, schedule runs, and test integrations entirely through the UI.

### Key Project Characteristics

1. **Zero Technical Debt Approach**: This project is being implemented with a focus on clean, maintainable code from the start, with no compromises for backward compatibility or legacy constraints.

2. **Development-Only Environment**: There are no production deployment or database migration concerns, allowing us to implement optimal solutions without worrying about existing users or data.

3. **Phased Implementation**: The project is divided into 6 major phases, each building on the previous work.

## Current Project Status (March 30, 2025)
