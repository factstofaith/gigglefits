### Key Architectural Patterns

The platform implements several key architectural patterns:

- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction in database models
- **Adapter Pattern**: Integration with various external systems
- **Factory Pattern**: Configuration management
- **Provider Pattern**: Context-based state management in frontend
- **Middleware Pattern**: Request processing, authentication, and logging
- **Dependency Injection**: Service instantiation and configuration
- **Rate Limiting**: API protection against abuse

### Component Interactions

The key components interact through well-defined interfaces:

1. **Frontend → Backend API**: REST API calls with JWT authentication
2. **Backend → External Systems**: Adapter-based integrations using configured credentials
3. **Backend → Database**: SQLAlchemy ORM for data persistence
4. **Integration Engine → Storage Systems**: Connector modules for Azure Blob, S3, SharePoint

## Backend Assessment

- **Database**: Configurable (SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- **Async Processing**: Background tasks for integration execution

### Module Structure

The backend is organized into logical modules:

```
backend/
├── adapters/             # Integration adapters
├── core/                 # Core configuration and settings
├── db/                   # Database models and migrations
