# TAP Integration Platform Assessment Project Plan

## Overview
This project plan outlines the steps needed to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the TAP Integration Platform application for both C-level executives and the development team. The assessment will cover architecture, code quality, features, performance, security, and development metrics.

## Objectives
1. Create a comprehensive C-level report focusing on business value, investment protection, and strategic alignment
2. Develop a detailed technical report for the development team highlighting architecture, code quality, and technical components
3. Provide accurate benchmarks against industry standards
4. Generate visual representations of the application including wireframes, architecture diagrams, and data flow models
5. Estimate resource requirements and development timeline
