# TAP Integration Platform Assessment

## Overview

This directory contains a comprehensive assessment of the TAP Integration Platform, analyzing its architecture, features, security, and development resource requirements.

## Main Assessment Reports

The assessment has been condensed into two comprehensive reports:

- **[TAP_Executive_Assessment_Report.md](TAP_Executive_Assessment_Report.md)** - Business-focused report for C-level executives
- **[TAP_Technical_Assessment_Report.md](TAP_Technical_Assessment_Report.md)** - Detailed technical assessment for the development team

## Supporting Documentation

The following supporting materials were used to create the main reports:

### Architecture & Design

- [Architecture Overview](assets/architecture-diagram.md) - High-level system architecture
- [Detailed Architecture](assets/architecture-detailed.md) - Detailed component interactions
- [Database Schema](assets/database-erd.md) - Entity-relationship diagrams and data models
- [Security Architecture](assets/security-architecture.md) - Security implementation design
- [UI Wireframes](ui-wireframes.md) - User interface layouts and interaction patterns

### Analysis

- [Feature Analysis](feature-analysis.md) - Assessment of platform features and capabilities
- [Security Assessment](security-assessment.md) - Security implementation evaluation
- [Resource Estimation](resource-estimation.md) - Development resource requirements and timeline
- [Assessment Project Plan](assessment-project-plan.md) - Project plan for the assessment process

## Generating PDF Reports

To generate PDF versions of the reports with the "PDF_" prefix, use the included Python script:

```bash
python generate-reports.py
```

Requirements:
- Python 3.6+
- Pandoc
- A PDF engine (wkhtmltopdf recommended)
- Optional: Eisvogel pandoc template for enhanced formatting

## Converting Diagrams to Images

To convert the Mermaid format diagrams to PNG images, use:

```bash
python convert-diagrams.py
```
